          <p>Over the last 11 years, KPT Mangaluru has established itself as a powerhouse in inter-polytechnic sports across Karnataka.</p>
          <p>Their journey is one of perseverance, discipline, and sustained excellence in both athletics and team sports.</p>
          <p>The institute's sports department has consistently groomed athletes who have not only excelled individually but also contributed to the team’s collective glory.</p>
          <p>Every year, KPT Mangaluru has fielded strong teams in major tournaments including athletics, football, volleyball, and kabaddi.</p>
          <p>Their dominance is particularly evident in the State-level Inter-Polytechnic Sports Meet, which is held annually across Karnataka.</p>
          <p>For 11 consecutive years, KPT Mangaluru has either won the championship or secured top positions, proving their consistency.</p>
          <p>The athletes are selected through rigorous trials and trained year-round under the guidance of expert coaches.</p>
          <p>These training programs focus not only on physical conditioning but also on strategic planning and teamwork.</p>
          <p>The institution conducts daily morning and evening practice sessions to instill discipline and build stamina.</p>
          <p>One of the key factors in their success is the department's emphasis on mental toughness and emotional resilience.</p>
          <p>In each of the past 11 years, KPT has earned recognition in multiple categories, including relay races, long jump, and group sports like football and volleyball.</p>
          <p>The sports department ensures equal attention is given to both boys' and girls' teams.</p>
          <p>Several female athletes from KPT Mangaluru have also represented the institution at state and national levels.</p>
          <p>With every win, the confidence of the players has grown, which has directly contributed to their ability to perform under pressure.</p>
          <p>The support system from the college — including administration, faculty, and parents — plays a crucial role in motivating the athletes.</p>
          <p>The department ensures that students maintain a healthy balance between academics and sports through personalized academic support.</p>
          <p>Nutrition, injury prevention, and recovery techniques are also part of the training curriculum.</p>
          <p>Over the years, the college has developed excellent infrastructure, including tracks, courts, and gyms.</p>
          <p>This infrastructure allows students to practice in conditions similar to professional environments.</p>
          <p>The college has also hosted inter-polytechnic meets, showing their commitment to not just participation but leadership in sports development.</p>
          <p>Guest lectures from sports psychologists and professional athletes help shape the mindset of students.</p>
          <p>KPT Mangaluru believes that success in sports teaches lifelong values such as leadership, humility, and perseverance.</p>
          <p>These values are visibly demonstrated by their alumni, many of whom have become coaches, PE teachers, or professional players.</p>
          <p>The alumni also often return to inspire current students, creating a strong sense of community and continuity.</p>
          <p>KPT’s teams are known for their sportsmanship, discipline, and respectful behavior on and off the field.</p>
          <p>They consistently earn admiration not only for their victories but also for their ethical conduct during matches.</p>
          <p>In every tournament over the past 11 years, KPT Mangaluru has featured prominently on the medals and trophies list.</p>
          <p>Their ability to adapt to different playing conditions and opponents shows their strategic depth.</p>
          <p>The coaching staff reviews every match, helping players learn from both victories and defeats.</p>
          <p>One of their most celebrated achievements came in the latest 44th State-level Inter-Polytechnic Meet.</p>
          <p>KPT Mangaluru emerged as the Overall Champion with a remarkable 52 points.</p>
          <p>This victory was especially meaningful because it took place at the prestigious Chamundi Vihar Stadium in Mysuru.</p>
          <p>The students outperformed nearly all other teams in both track and group events.</p>
          <p>They secured first-place finishes in relays, sprints, and even field events like discus and javelin.</p>
          <p>Their coordination in team sports like kabaddi and football was unmatched.</p>
          <p>The Sulya KVG Polytechnic team came second, with 21 points — far behind KPT’s dominating 52.</p>
          <p>This wide gap in points highlights the exceptional performance of KPT’s athletes.</p>
          <p>The team celebrated with pride, hoisting the trophy and posing for photographs, as seen in the news image.</p>
          <p>The victory wasn’t just about athleticism — it represented years of planning, hard work, and collective vision.</p>
          <p>It was a proud moment for the entire KPT family — students, staff, alumni, and parents.</p>
          <p>The Principal and Sports Director congratulated the team and announced further support for expanding sports facilities.</p>
          <p>This win added to their already impressive trophy cabinet, reinforcing their dominance.</p>
          <p>The team members became instant heroes among their peers and younger students.</p>
          <p>Their success is inspiring more students to join sports and maintain a disciplined, healthy lifestyle.</p>
          <p>The department is already preparing for future tournaments to defend their title and aim even higher.</p>
          <p>The focus is now on developing more players for state and national selection.</p>
          <p>With consistent investment in coaching, fitness, and infrastructure, KPT’s reign seems far from over.</p>
          <p>The team’s journey over 11 years proves that discipline and passion always yield results.</p>
          <p>They’ve built a sporting legacy that inspires not just their college, but all of Karnataka’s polytechnic students.</p>
          <p>With this latest victory, KPT Mangaluru has once again proven that they are the true champions — not just in medals, but in spirit.</p>
